# Executive Summary

## Our main goal

The main goal of this report is to analyze data about Airbnb listing in Istanbul and fit a model to predict the total cost for two people staying 4 nights in an AirBnB there.

## Our approach

In order to tackle this problem, we have divided the work into 4 main parts

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We used this part as an opportunity to clean our data and understand it by visualization

* Many variables were not stored in the appropriate data type. We therefore had to do some data wrangling to convert them. In addition, we had to handle missing values by either deleting the observation or by assigning them to an appropriate numeric value. We also tried to simplify variables, since the vast majority of the observations were in one of the top 5 categories.

* We then visualized our variable by looking at the distribution of numeric continuous variable and the relationship between price and variables of interest.

### Mapping

In this part, we go into the geospatial visualizations to get an overview of the spatial distribution of AirBnbs in Istanbul. 

### Regression Analysis

After defining our target variable price_4_nights, we took an iterative approach to building an optimal model. To do so, we built 7 models in which we iteratively included predictors to see their effect and significance. 

Our best model include the following variable:
* property_type_simplified  
* number_of_reviews 
* review_scores_rating  
* room_type 
* bathrooms  
* bedrooms  
* accommodates 
* host_is_superhost 
* cancellation_policy_simplified 
* is_location_exact 
* neighbourhood_simplified 
* host_identity_verified 
* equipments 
* instant_bookable

## Our findings

Our estimate for the cost for two people staying 4 nights in Istanbul is 741 with a 95% confidence interval of 539 to 1075

# Exploring Data Analysis

## Loading the data

We first load the data from insideairbnb.com

```{r raw_data, cache = TRUE}
#getting and cleanning the data names
raw_data <- vroom("http://data.insideairbnb.com/turkey/marmara/istanbul/2020-06-28/data/listings.csv.gz") %>% 
  clean_names()

```

## Looking at raw data

Then, we take a first look at the data using glimpse and skim

```{r}
glimpse(raw_data)
```

```{r}
skim(raw_data)
```


We see that the data set is composed of 106 variables and 23,728 observations.

Even though there are many variables in the dataframe, here is a quick description of some of the variables collected. Cost data is typically expressed in US$

* price = cost per night
* cleaning_fee: cleaning fee
* extra_people: charge for having more than 1 person
* property_type: type of accommodation (House, Apartment, etc.)
* room_type:
** Entire home/apt (guests have entire place to themselves)
** Private room (Guests have private room to sleep, all other rooms shared)
** Shared room (Guests sleep in room shared with others)
* number_of_reviews: Total number of reviews for the listing
* review_scores_rating: Average review score (0 - 100)
*longitude , latitude: geographical coordinates to help us locate the listing
*neighborhood: three variables on a few major neighborhoods in each city

## Cleanning data

The data set is quite messy. We therefore go through this process of cleaning the data 

Many of the variables will not help us in our analysis. We can select the variables of interest and store them into listing

```{r}
#Cleaning and selecting variables of interest
listing <- raw_data %>% 
  select(id,
         listing_url,
         price,
         cleaning_fee,
         extra_people, 
         property_type,  
         room_type,
         number_of_reviews,
         review_scores_rating,  
         latitude,
         longitude,
         is_location_exact,
         neighbourhood_cleansed, 
         neighbourhood_group_cleansed,
         neighbourhood, 
         bathrooms,
         bedrooms,
         beds,
         host_identity_verified,
         host_is_superhost,
         accommodates,
        cancellation_policy,
        minimum_nights,
        guests_included,
        amenities,
        instant_bookable,
        square_feet
        )

#take a look at our new data set
glimpse(listing)
```

Some variables are not stored in the right format. For example, price is stored as a character when we actually want a numeric value. We can mutate it by using the parse_number function to resolve this issue.

```{r}
#make sure prices, cleaning fee and extra people are store as numeric 
listing <- listing %>% 
  mutate(price = parse_number(price)) %>% 
  mutate(cleaning_fee = parse_number(cleaning_fee)) %>% 
  mutate(extra_people = parse_number(extra_people))

```

We believe that having Wifi is something valuable and that some people would be willing to pay a premium for it. 
We also think that the more amenities a place has the higher the price would be. Hence, we create a variable for both of them.

```{r}
#we create air_conditioning and equipments variable
listing <- listing %>% 
  #detect every listing that include "Air conditioning" in their amenities
  mutate(Wifi = str_detect(amenities, "Wifi")) %>% 
  #calculate the number of amenities by calculating the number of comma and adding 1
  mutate(equipments = str_count(amenities, ",")+1)

#take a look at our new data to see whether there are some missing values
listing %>% 
  select(price, cleaning_fee, extra_people, Wifi, equipments) %>% 
  skim() %>% 
  kable %>% 
  kable_styling()

```

We see that cleaning fee has many missing values (13660). We believe that if the landlord did not state any cleaning fee that must be because there are no fees (ie cleaning = 0). The same reasoning applies to bedrooms (ie in shared room for example), beds (sofa instead), bathrooms. Lastly, we believe that if the data is missing for host is a super host that must be because they are not one. 

```{r}
#replacing NA for 0 in cleaning fee
listing <- listing %>% 
  mutate(cleaning_fee = case_when(
    is.na(cleaning_fee) ~ 0,
    TRUE ~ cleaning_fee
  ))

#replacing NA for 0 in bedroom
listing <- listing %>% 
  mutate(bedrooms = case_when(
    is.na(bedrooms) ~ 0,
    TRUE ~ bedrooms
  ))

#replacing NA for 0 in beds
listing <- listing %>% 
  mutate(beds = case_when(
    is.na(beds) ~ 0,
    TRUE ~ beds
  ))

#replacing NA for 0 in bathrooms
listing <- listing %>% 
  mutate(bathrooms = case_when(
    is.na(bathrooms) ~ 0,
    TRUE ~ bathrooms
  ))

#replacing NA for FALSE. Assuming that if we don't have information on whether a host is a superhost then he is not one 
listing <- listing %>% 
  mutate(host_is_superhost = case_when(
    is.na(host_is_superhost) ~ FALSE,
    TRUE ~ host_is_superhost
  ))

#replacing NA for FALSE. Assuming that if we don't have information on host identity verification it must be because he is not verified.
listing <- listing %>% 
  mutate(host_identity_verified = case_when(
    is.na(host_identity_verified) ~ FALSE,
    TRUE ~ host_identity_verified
  ))

```

As we can see, there are a lot of different property types.  

```{r}
#first we count the number of observation in each propety type
count(listing, property_type, sort = TRUE) 
```

We want to group them in 6 main categories and the rest in another.

```{r}
#we create property_type_simplified to get only 7 types (including others)
listing <- listing %>% 
  mutate(property_type_simplified = case_when(
    property_type %in% c("Apartment", 
                         "Serviced apartment", 
                         "House",
                         "Boutique hotel",
                         "Townhouse",
                         "Bed an breakfast"
                        ) ~ property_type, 
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))


#check if correctly made
count(listing, property_type_simplified, sort = TRUE)
```

We can do the same for the cancellation policy by grouping them in 3 categories (flexible, moderate and strict)

```{r}
#we count the number of observation in each category
count(listing, cancellation_policy, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#cancellation policy tidy
#we create cancellation policy simplified to get only 3 types
listing <- listing %>% 
  mutate(cancellation_policy_simplified = case_when(
    cancellation_policy %in% c("flexible", "moderate") ~ cancellation_policy,
    TRUE ~ "strict"
  ))

#check
count(listing, cancellation_policy_simplified, sort = TRUE)

```

Istanbul has 39 districts. 

```{r}
#looking at the number of different districts
count(listing, neighbourhood_cleansed, sort = TRUE)
```

After talking with local and doing some research, we managed to group them in 5 categories ranked from top, best, good, average and worse. This ranking is based on social welfare status, education, health, social life, municipality services and transportation levels.

```{r}
count(listing, neighbourhood_cleansed, sort = TRUE)

top_district <- c("Beykov","Adalar", "Buyukcekmece")
best_district <- c("Arnavutkoy", "Sile", "Silivri", "Sariyer", "Fatih", "Beylikduzu")
good_district <- c("Catalca", "Sisli","Basaksenir", "Umraniye", "Bayrampasa", "Kucukcekmece")
worse_district <- c("Sancaktepe", "Esenler", "Kadikoy", "Maltepe", "Avcilar")
#average_district <- c() the rest is average to gain some time and alleviate typing error we consider it as other

listing <- listing %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood_simplified = case_when(neighbourhood_cleansed %in% top_district ~ "Top",
                                              neighbourhood_cleansed %in% best_district ~ "Best",
                                              neighbourhood_cleansed %in% good_district ~ "Good",
                                              neighbourhood_cleansed %in% worse_district ~ "Worse",
                                              TRUE ~ "Average"))
#Check
count(listing, neighbourhood_simplified, sort = TRUE)
```
Lets now take a look at the number of nights people stay in an Airbnb. 

```{r}
count(listing, minimum_nights, sort = TRUE)
```

As we can see, most people stay in Airbnb between 1 to 4 days. 
Airbnb is most commonly used for travel purposes (i.e. alternative to hotel). We can see that a lot of people are staying a week as well. 
We have decided to filter out the observation that requires the customer to stay more than 4 days.  

```{r}
#we remove the listing that require a stay of 5 or above days
listing <- listing %>% 
  filter(minimum_nights <= 4)
```

Later we will be using variable review score and accommodate in our regression. Therefore we want to filter out the observation which contain an NA
```{r}
#removing NA
listing <- listing %>% 
  filter(is.na(review_scores_rating) == FALSE) %>% 
  filter(is.na(accommodates) == FALSE)

```

## Creating our dependent variable

We create a new variable that uses price, cleanning fee, guests included and extra people to calculate the total cost for two people to stay at the Airbnb for 4 nights. We can divide into 2 cases:
* When guests included is 1. This means that we not only have to pay price and cleaning fee but also the extra people fee.
* When guests included is greater than 1. In this case you only pay the price and the cleaning fee.

```{r}
listing<- listing %>% 
  mutate(price_4_nights= case_when(
    guests_included == 1 ~ 4*price+cleaning_fee+4*extra_people,
    TRUE ~ 4*price+cleaning_fee
  ))
```

Lastly, we deselect the variable that we wont be using further in our analysis. 

```{r}
listing_cleaned <- listing %>% 
  select(-c(property_type, neighbourhood, neighbourhood_group_cleansed, cancellation_policy, cleaning_fee, extra_people))
```

## Creating informative visualizations

### Summary
```{r}
summary <- listing_cleaned %>% 
  select(c(price, price_4_nights, review_scores_rating, number_of_reviews, bathrooms, bedrooms, accommodates))

skim(summary) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling
```

As we can see from the table the average price for 4 nights is $1765.96 and the distribution is negatively skewed.

### Property type distribution
```{r}
property_type_distribution_plot <- listing_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = property_type_simplified))+
  geom_bar(fill = "salmon")+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Most of the property are apartments", x= "Property", y = "count")+
  NULL

property_type_distribution_plot
```

Our dataset is composed of mainly apartments. This makes sense as we are looking at properties that can accommodate 2 individuals for 4 nights.

### Number of reviews distribution

```{r}
number_reviews_distribution_plot <- listing_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= number_of_reviews))+
  geom_density(fill = "salmon")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(listing_cleaned$number_of_reviews), color = "blue", size = 1)+
  geom_text(aes(x = mean(listing_cleaned$number_of_reviews), y = 0, label = round(mean(listing_cleaned$number_of_reviews))))+
  theme_minimal()+
  xlim(0,50)+
  labs(title = "The number of review distribution is negatively squewed", x = "Number of reviews", y = "Density")+
  NULL

number_reviews_distribution_plot
```

On average a property has 18 reviews. However, this distribution is strongly skewed. 

## Review score distribution

```{r}
review_score_distribution_plot <- listing_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = review_scores_rating))+
  geom_density(fill = "salmon")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(listing_cleaned$review_scores_rating), color = "blue", size = 1)+
  geom_text(aes(x = mean(listing_cleaned$review_scores_rating), y = 0, label = round(mean(listing_cleaned$review_scores_rating))))+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "The average score is 91", x = "Score", y = "Density")+
  NULL

review_score_distribution_plot
```

On average properties have a rating of 91. However, this distribution is strongly positivly skewed.

### Room type distribution
```{r}
room_type_distribution_plot <- listing_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = room_type))+
  geom_bar(fill = "salmon")+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Most of the listing are either entire home or private room", x= "Property", y = "count")+
  NULL

room_type_distribution_plot
```

### Number of beds distribution
```{r}
beds_distribution_plot <- listing_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = beds))+
  geom_bar(fill = "salmon")+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Most of the properties have between 1 to 10 beds", x = "Beds", y = "count")+
  xlim(0,11)+
  NULL

beds_distribution_plot
```

### Host is a super host distribution
```{r}
super_host_distribution_plot <- listing_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = host_is_superhost)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "salmon")+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Being a superhosts is a rare feature", x = "Super host", y = "Density") +
  NULL

super_host_distribution_plot
```

### Cancellation policy distribution 
```{r}
cancellation_policy_distribution_plot <- listing_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cancellation_policy_simplified))+
  geom_bar(fill = "salmon")+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Most of the property have flexible policy", x = "Cancellation Policy", y = "count")+
  NULL

cancellation_policy_distribution_plot
```

## Correlation between variables

We inspect numeric variables for correlations among them and most importantly with price_4_nights

### Summary
```{r}
listing_cleaned %>% 
  select(price_4_nights, number_of_reviews, review_scores_rating, accommodates, bathrooms, bedrooms) %>% 
  ggpairs() + theme_minimal()
```

We see a strong correlation between beds, bedrooms, bathroom and accommodates which makes sense. That is to say, a flat with many bathrooms is likely to have many bedrooms as well. Nonetheless, a correlation of 0.735 between bathrooms and bedrooms is quite high. We would need to be careful when creating our model to avoid multicollinearity 

### Property type and Price_4_nights  
```{r}
property_price <- listing_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = property_type_simplified, y = price_4_nights))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Price for different property types", x = "", y = "Price for 2 people for 4 nights")+
  ylim(100, 5000)+
  NULL

```

### Number of review and price_4_nights
```{r}
review_price <- listing_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = number_of_reviews, price_4_nights))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(title = "Relationship between price and number of reviews", x = "Number of reviews", y = "price for 2 people for 4 nights")+
  ylim(100, 5000)+
  theme_minimal()+
  NULL

```

### Review score rating and price_4_nights
```{r}
score_price <- listing_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = review_scores_rating, price_4_nights))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(title = "Relationship between price and number of reviews", x = "Number of reviews", y = "price for 2 people for 4 nights")+
  ylim(100, 5000)+
  theme_minimal()+
  NULL

```


### Roomtype and price_4_nights
```{r}
room_price <- listing_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = room_type, y = price_4_nights))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Price for different property type", x = "", y = "Price for 2 people for 4 nights")+
  ylim(100, 5000)+
  NULL


```

```{r}
grid.arrange(room_price, score_price, review_price, property_price, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)
```

As we can see from the plot above, we cannot detect a strong relationship between price and a certain variable. Therefore, it makes sense to use a model to combine those variable in order to predict the prices.

# Mapping

```{r}
leaflet(data = filter(raw_data, minimum_nights <= 4)) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude, 
                   radius = 1, 
                   fillColor = "blue", 
                   fillOpacity = 0.4, 
                   popup = ~listing_url,
                   label = ~property_type)
```

As expected, most of the Airbnb are in the city center or near the coastline.

# Regression Analysis

## Distribution of price_4_nights

First we can analyze the distribution of price_4_nights, our target variable. 
```{r}
distribution_Y <- listing_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = price_4_nights)) +
  geom_density(fill = "salmon", color = "salmon", alpha = 0.7 )+
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(listing_cleaned$price_4_nights), color = "black", size = 1)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = median(listing_cleaned$price_4_nights), color = "blue", size = 1)+
  geom_text(aes(x = mean(listing_cleaned$price_4_nights), y = 0, label = round(mean(listing_cleaned$price_4_nights))))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format())+
  labs(title = "Distribution of price is positively skewed", x = "Price", y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()+
  xlim(0,10000)+
  NULL

```

```{r}
distribution_Y_log <- listing_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(log(price_4_nights))) +
  geom_density(fill = "salmon", color = "salmon", alpha = 0.7 )+
  geom_vline(xintercept = median(log(listing_cleaned$price_4_nights)), color = "blue", size = 1)+
  geom_text(aes(x = mean(listing_cleaned$price_4_nights), y = 0, label = round(mean(listing_cleaned$price_4_nights))))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format())+
  labs(title = "Log distribution of price follow a normal distribution", x = "Price", y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()+
  xlim(0,25)+
  NULL

```

```{r}
grid.arrange(distribution_Y, distribution_Y_log, nrow = 1, ncol = 2)
```

As we can see, the distribution of price_4_nights is heavily skewed. Therefore, it makes sense to do a log transformation to make it more normally distributed. From this point we will use the log of price_4_nights as our dependent variable

## Model 1: Property type, number of reviews, and review scores ratings

We fit a regression model on log(price_4_nights) with the following explanatory variables: 
* property_type_simplified
* number_of_reviews
* review_scores_rating

```{r}
model1 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ 
               property_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating, 
             data = listing_cleaned)

model1 %>% 
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()

```

```{r}
model1 %>% 
  broom::glance() %>% 
  kable %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

**Property_type**: The base category is apartments (the model drops it for dummy variable trap). Therefore, all the other coefficient in property type can be interpret as a function of apartment. Serviced apartment has a coefficient of 0.18 which means that if the property is a serviced apartment it cost 19.71% ((EXP(0.041)-1)*100) than an apartment. The same interpretation can be applied across all types.

**Number_of_reviews**: has an estimates of 0.002. Therefore, the variable has little to no impact.

**review_score_rating**: Similarly to the number of reviews it has little predictive power with an estimate of 0.001 and a p-value above 5%

Our model1 has an adjusted R squared of 0.01. This represents a poor performance measure as only 1% of the variance can be explain using this model.

## Model 2: adding roomtype

We can include room_type in mode1 to construct our model2

```{r}
model2 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ 
               property_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type, 
             data = listing_cleaned)

model2 %>% 
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()

```

```{r}
model2 %>% 
  broom::glance() %>% 
  kable %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

The first thing we notice is that our adjusted R squared has increase significantly to a value of 22.6%. Our model is now able to better explain the variance.
All the coefficient in room_type are statistically significant with p-value of 0. The estimates for shared room is -1.054 which means that they are 65.14% cheaper than entire flat. 

## Model 3: adding bathrooms, bedrooms, beds, and accomodates 

We can now look at bathrooms, bedrooms, beds and size of the house (accomodates) to see if they are significant predictors of price.

```{r}
model3 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ 
               property_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type + 
               bathrooms + 
               beds + 
               bedrooms + 
               accommodates, 
             data = listing_cleaned)

model3 %>% 
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()

```

```{r}
model3 %>% 
  broom::glance() %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```
```{r}
car::vif(model3)
```

Again, our adjusted R squared has increase significantly to 34.9%. However, we can see that beds is statistically insignificant. Therefore, we could take it off and it would not affect our R squared. For the rest of the analysis we will still keep it as it can become significant when adding other variable.
Also, we checked at the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and we dont seem to have any collinear variables so far. 

## Model 4: adding host is a super host

We can now include the variable host_is_superhost to see whether being a superhost increase the price of your listing. 

```{r}
model4 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ 
               property_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type + 
               bathrooms + 
               beds + 
               bedrooms + 
               accommodates + 
               host_is_superhost, 
             data = listing_cleaned)

model4 %>% 
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()

```

```{r}
model4 %>% 
  broom::glance() %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

```{r}
car::vif(model4)
```

Host is a superhost is statistically significant with a p-value of 0. Being a superhost command a price premium of 13%. 
Because we added this new significant variable our adjusted R squared increased. 

## Model 5: adding location exact

A non trivial proportion of owners dont advertise their exact location. We want to check if advertising your exact location after controlling for other variables is a significant predictor of price.

```{r}
model5 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ 
               property_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type + 
               bathrooms + 
               beds + 
               bedrooms + 
               accommodates + 
               host_is_superhost + 
               is_location_exact, 
             data = listing_cleaned)

model5 %>% 
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()

```

```{r}
model5 %>% 
  broom::glance() %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

```{r}
car::vif(model5)
```

As we can see is_location_exact is significant. Which means that advertising your eact location leads to  a price premia. Nonetheless, the estimates is fairly low. In other words, listing with exact location have a price premia of 2.7% compare to those not providing their exact location. 

## Model 6: adding neighbourhood_simplified

We can also add our neighborhood simplified variable which ranks neighborhood in 5 categories based on social welfare status, education, health, social life, municipality services and transportation levels.

```{r}
model6 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ 
               property_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type + 
               bathrooms + 
               beds + 
               bedrooms + 
               accommodates + 
               host_is_superhost + 
               is_location_exact + 
               neighbourhood_simplified, 
             data = listing_cleaned)

model6 %>% 
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()

```

```{r}
model6 %>% 
  broom::glance() %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

```{r}
car::vif(model6)
```

Neighbourhood simplified variable is significant variable. The model uses average as the base case. As expected the top, best and good district have a positive estimate and the worse district a negative one.
We still dont have any collinearity issue (VIF < 5)

## Model 7: adding cancellation_policy_simplified

We will now look at the effect of cancellation policy (flexible, moderate and strict)

```{r}
model7 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ 
               property_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type + 
               bathrooms + 
               beds + 
               bedrooms + 
               accommodates + 
               host_is_superhost + 
               is_location_exact + 
               neighbourhood_simplified +
               cancellation_policy_simplified,
             data = listing_cleaned)

model7 %>% 
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

```{r}
model7 %>% 
  broom::glance() %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

```{r}
car::vif(model7)
```

We see that the model use the flexible cancellation policy as the base case. The variable is statistically significant. Interestingly, it is that the estimate for strict and moderate are positive. Meaning that having a strict policy leads to an increase in price. The reason for that is probably that cancellation policy acts for a proxy of the quality of the accommodation. That is to say, high quality (and therefore high price) listing are more likely to have a strict policy.

# Model Prediction

## Final Model
We now create our last and final model. In this model we add the instant booking feature, the number of amenities (equipments), the wifi variable and if the host identity is verified 

```{r}
model_final <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ 
               property_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type + 
               bathrooms + 
               beds + 
               bedrooms + 
               accommodates + 
               host_is_superhost + 
               cancellation_policy_simplified + 
               is_location_exact + 
               neighbourhood_simplified + 
               host_identity_verified + 
               equipments + 
               instant_bookable+
               Wifi,
             data = listing_cleaned)

model_final %>% 
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

We see that both beds and wifi are statiscially insignificant. Therefore we decide to get rid of them in our final model.

```{r}
model_final <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ 
               property_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type + 
               bathrooms + 
               bedrooms + 
               accommodates + 
               host_is_superhost + 
               cancellation_policy_simplified + 
               is_location_exact + 
               neighbourhood_simplified + 
               host_identity_verified + 
               equipments + 
               instant_bookable,
             data = listing_cleaned)

model_final %>% 
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

```{r}
model_final %>% 
  broom::glance() %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

```{r}
car::vif(model_final)
```

This is the best model we could get. We have an adjusted R squared of 37.3%. This is still fairly low but considering how messy the data is we are satisfied with it. Also, our final model don't show any sign of collinearity which is a good thing. 

## Model Diagnostics
We can use the autoplot function to check the assumptions of regression. 

```{r}
autoplot(model_final) + theme_minimal()
```

As we can see:
**Residual vs Fitted**: we have a horizontal line which is good.
**Normal Q-Q**: shows that our residual approximately follows a normal distribution
**Scale-Location**: the constant variance assumption seems to hold
**Redisual vs Leverage**: it seems that some variable have a big absolute residual and therefore influence on estimates. We would need to investigate this further. 

## Model comparison

We can now compare all of our model in a summary table. We see that by using this incremental approach we managed to increase the R squared significantly.

```{r}
huxreg(model1, model2, model3, model4, model5, model6, model7, model_final,
        statistics = c('#observations' = 'nobs', 
                                'R squared' = 'r.squared', 
                                'Adj. R Squared' = 'adj.r.squared', 
                                'Residual SE' = 'sigma'), 
                 bold_signif = 0.05, 
                 stars = NULL
) %>% 
  set_caption('Comparison of models')
```

## Forecasting

In this last part we want to come up with our best prediction for the price of a nights stay in Istanbul for 2 people.  
Our requirements are :
* Apartments
* Private room
* Review >=10
* Average rating >= 90

We use the prediction package to find our final answer
```{r}
library(stats)
library(datasets)
library(prediction)
 
forecasting <- listing_cleaned %>% 
  filter(accommodates>=2,
         room_type == "Private room",
         property_type_simplified == "Apartment",
         review_scores_rating>= 90,
         number_of_reviews>=10) %>% 
  mutate(prediction = exp(predict(model_final, .)))

```

```{r}
average_prediction <- mean(forecasting$prediction)
CI_upper <- quantile(forecasting$prediction, 0.975)
CI_lower <- quantile(forecasting$prediction, 0.025)
```

```{r}
average_prediction
```
Our average prediction of price of a 4 nights stay is $741

```{r}
CI_lower
```

```{r}
CI_upper
```

The 95% confidence interval is [539; 1075]

```{r}
ggplot(forecasting, aes(x = prediction)) +
  geom_density(fill = "grey")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = average_prediction, color = "red")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = CI_lower, color = "blue")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = CI_upper, color = "blue")+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format())+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "The predicted price of a 4 nights stay in Istanbul for 2 is $741", subtitle = "The confidence interval is $539 to $1075")+
  NULL
```
